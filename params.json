Open index.html in Chrome and enjoy. -there's no server side of this. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Commands are handled by \"handlers\", which are automatic loaded when called. They can be dynamically dropped into ./js/handlers. For example, all commands that starts with user will be handled by user.js inside handlers folder.\r\n\r\n* Commands can interact with other commands just like you would do it in a shell.\r\n\r\n* To store sensitive information, use the user command. \r\n\r\nInitial Goal: build a basic framework to have dropbox credentials stored and use them in command line. The project should potentially be used in Node.js as well. \r\n\r\n### user.js - handles user creation, login, and key management. \r\n----------\r\n1. user create username - create a user and generate a key for encrypting user data, all the user data are encrypted using this key, the key itself is encrypted using the password.\r\n2. user login username - login as username, upon successful login, the key will be decrypted for the current session.\r\n\r\n### dropbox.js - uses user handler to store user dropbox information and acts as a wrapper for dropbox api.\r\n----------\r\n1. dorpbox use api_key api_secret to initialize the handler. - one time. \r\n2. dropbox login username - to authenticate an account for the current api. -one time.\r\n3. dropbox cd ... allows dropbox to act as a folder and interface with cd.js. \r\n3. dropbox ls ... allows dropbox to act as a folder and interface with ls.js. \r\n\r\n### cd.js - allows changing the base handler and make shortcuts, perhaps for folder options.\r\n---------\r\n1. cd handler_name will make the rest of the cd command to be handled as \"handler_name cd ...\" \r\n2. cd ~ will reset the handler for cd.\r\n\r\n### ls.js - allows changing the base handler and make shortcuts, perhaps for folder options.\r\n---------\r\n1. uses the same handler as cd.js, handle all the commands as \"handler_name ls ...\"","tagline":"Fun project that allows one to use the web services using shell commands","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
